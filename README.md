Understanding and Implementing SOLID Principles in Javascript

SOLID

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   Each class should have only one responsibility.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
   Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
